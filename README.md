🚀 How to Use

Since this application relies on the browser's access to motion sensors, there are two crucial prerequisites for it to work:


⚙️ Technical Details

The core functionality of the compass relies on listening to the ANdroid device Sensors.

🤝 Contributing

This is a simple project for demonstration and educational purposes. If you'd like to extend it, here are a few ideas:

Display True North by integrating Geolocation to calculate magnetic declination.

Add tick marks and degree markings around the main compass ring.

Implement more detailed error logging for different sensor failure modes.
